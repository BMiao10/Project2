In this assignment, you will evaluate results from a high-throughput virtual screen against the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein / Human ACE2 interface.  There are two parts to this assignment and Part 2 requires completion of Part 1. We recommend reading through both Part 1 and Part 2 before beginning this assignment. 

* Part 1 - API and implementation
* Part 2 - Evaluating clustering
